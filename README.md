# A Friend In Need

###Helping the world become a better place for you and me
##The IDEA
A Friend In Need aims to assist visually challenged
individuals become more productive and independent. The
hinderance of not being able to see the world around you is
unimaginable and we cannot fathom the courage it takes to
overcome that and live your life as beautifully as these
people do.
We may not be able to completely comprehend their efforts
but we can applaud and assist them. Right from where we are.
The application is divided in two fronts - one for
volunteers and one for those seeking assistance.
